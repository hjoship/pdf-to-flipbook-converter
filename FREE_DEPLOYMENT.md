## ⚠️ **Why Not Netlify?**

Netlify is amazing but only for **static sites** (HTML/CSS/JS). Your PDF converter is a **Python Flask server** that needs to:
- Process PDF files server-side
- Run Python code
- Handle file uploads
- Generate ZIP downloads

These require a **backend server**, which Netlify doesn't provide.

---

## 💡 **Alternative: Static Version**

If you want to use Netlify, we could create a **client-side only** version using:
- **PDF.js** for PDF rendering
- **JavaScript Canvas** for image generation
- **Client-side ZIP** creation

But this would be much more limited and complex. The server-side version is much better!
